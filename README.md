# Easy-Axes-1.0
This project involved the development of a Math Assistant software using JAVA, which enables the children to perform mathematical calculations and construct and understand functional graphs with ease. These Children, affected by cerebral palsy, are physically inept and are capable of only minimal movement of fingers. All arithmetic calculations, linear graphs and geometric shapes can be easily drawn and understood by them without having to move their hands at all.The User interface of this software involves a scan which moves on the screen over the objects present and whenever the required object is highlighted, a click of the mouse with the cursor anywhere on the screen selects that object.
